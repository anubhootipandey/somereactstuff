/*------------------------React Fiber--------------------------*/


1. What is React Fiber, and why was it introduced?

--> React Fiber is a new reconciliation algorithm in React that improves performance, making the rendering process more efficient, especially in complex apps.


2. How does React Fiber improve React's rendering process?

--> Fiber breaks rendering into smaller chunks, allowing React to prioritize updates and pause tasks if needed, which makes apps feel faster and smoother.


3. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous rendering in React Fiber?

--> Synchronous rendering: Updates happen in one go, blocking the app until complete.
Asynchronous rendering: React can pause and continue work, making the app more responsive by handling tasks in smaller pieces.
