/*------------------------Lists and Keys--------------------------*/


1. How do you render lists in React?

--> Use the map() function to loop through an array and return a component for each item.


2. Why is it important to use key props when rendering lists?

--> Keys help React efficiently update and manage changes in lists by identifying which items have changed, been added, or removed.


3. What are the consequences of not using unique keys in list rendering?

--> Without unique keys, React may have trouble identifying items, leading to performance issues and unexpected behavior when the list updates.
