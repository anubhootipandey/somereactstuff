/*------------------------React Context API--------------------------*/


1. What is the React Context API, and how is it used?

--> The Context API is used to share data between components without passing props through every level of the component tree (called prop drilling).


2. What are the benefits of using Context over prop drilling?

--> Context makes it easier to share data across many components without passing props through every single parent and child, reducing complexity.


3. How do you create a context and use it in a React application?

--> You create a context with React.createContext() and use Provider to wrap components and useContext to access the context data in child components.
