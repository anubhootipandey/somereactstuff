/*------------------------Refs--------------------------*/


1. What are refs in React, and how do you use them?

--> Refs are used to access and interact with DOM elements or component instances directly. They can get the value of an input or focus on an element.


2. How do you create a ref in a class component vs a functional component?

--> Class component: Use React.createRef() and attach it to an element.
Functional component: Use the useRef hook to create refs.


3. What are forward refs in React?

--> Forward refs let you pass a ref from a parent component to a child component, giving the parent access to the childâ€™s DOM or component instance.
