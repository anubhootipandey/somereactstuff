      question: "What is the difference between state and props?",
      answer: "Both props and state are plain JavaScript objects. While both hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in their functionality with respect to components. Props get passed to the component similar to function parameters, whereas the state is managed within the component similar to variables declared within a function."
