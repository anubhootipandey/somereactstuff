1.Babel: Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript code into backward-compatible versions that 
        can run in older browsers or environments that don't support the latest JavaScript features. It allows 
        developers to write code using the latest syntax and features without worrying about compatibility issues.
2.env: In the context of Babel, "env" stands for environment. Babel's env preset allows developers to specify which 
        versions of JavaScript they want to target based on the environments where their code will run. For example, 
        you can configure Babel to compile your code to support specific versions of browsers or Node.js environments.
3.Prettier: Prettier is a code formatting tool that helps maintain consistent code style across a project. 
        It automatically formats code according to predefined rules, such as indentation, line length, and spacing. 
        Prettier can be integrated into code editors or run as a standalone tool, making it easy to enforce code 
        formatting standards in development workflows.
4.Linter: A linter is a static code analysis tool that identifies potential errors, bugs, or code style violations in 
        your codebase. It helps maintain code quality and consistency by flagging issues based on predefined rules or 
        coding standards. Linters can check for syntax errors, variable naming conventions, unused variables, and other 
        common coding pitfalls. Popular JavaScript linters include ESLint and JSHint.
In summary, Babel is a JavaScript compiler used for transpiling code, the "env" preset in Babel helps target specific 
JavaScript environments, Prettier is a code formatting tool for maintaining consistent code style, and a linter is a tool 
for identifying and enforcing coding standards and best practices. These tools are often used together in modern 
JavaScript development workflows to improve code quality, maintainability, and compatibility across different environments.
